  "description": "Welcome to the MieterEngel coding challenge! Your mission, should you accept it, is to build a page that our customers can use to take a picture of a page with their mobile phone and send the picture to us via email. For the frontend part of this work please use React, every other decision about which frameworks you use is up to you. The choice will only matter for the evaluation insofar as e. g. adding buggy external dependencies will also affect the stability of your code.",
